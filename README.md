# Tonnet

I often find myself missing certain functionality in the .NET libraries. This project contains several classes and functions that I find useful. They help with a broad range of problems, ranging from working with containers to functional programming.

Although the library has a broad range of tools, its generic goal is to make life easier when programming in C#.
